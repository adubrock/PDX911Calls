PDX 911 Calls
=============

The PDX911Calls project is a three-phase website that logs the 911 calls in Portland so residents can review them.

* The first phase allows users to search for calls using multiple  parameters (including a date range and location).

* The second phase provides account/sign-in so that users can specify an 'alert' area, and then receive email and/or SMS updates if a call is made within that area.

* The third phase provides a mobile-friendly version of the site, along with help for purchasing a police report related to the call.

*Please see the wiki for this repository for much more information on the site, including a [Brief](https://github.com/adubrock/Portland-Police-Call-Website/wiki/Brief), [User Stories page](https://github.com/adubrock/Portland-Police-Call-Website/wiki/User-Stories), [Wireframes](https://github.com/adubrock/Portland-Police-Call-Website/wiki/Wireframes), [Production Notes and Documentation](https://github.com/adubrock/PDX911Calls/wiki/Production-Notes-and-Documentation) and [Gems and Modules Needed](https://github.com/adubrock/Portland-Police-Call-Website/wiki/Gems-and-Modules-needed).*
